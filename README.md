# Ifan's website

This will be the code for my [website](https://ifanbaines.com). This is long project where I will learn to improve me HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills before continuing to learn the back-end. The original concept was to have a website to host my mathematics projects alone, but I decided to expand its scope to any project I think is "academic" enough.

Todo:

- Create template for items in project list
- Write about current projects
- Figure out how to configure make4ht
- Create satisfying theme/layout
